Hello! This is a collection of all of the lab reports that I wrote as part of Newport High School's CISCO CCNP and Cybersecurity classes. In those classes, we covered a wide range of networking topics, from configuring routing protocols like OSPF, to creating tunnels and VPNs. 

Our networks were built on racks of CISCO routers and switches. For the firewalls, we mainly used Palo Alto and FortiNet devices. We used PuTTY as our CLI. The network diagrams were made using draw.io.

The lab reports are currently in one large Word Doc.
