Hello! This is a collection of all of the lab reports that I wrote as part of Newport High School's CISCO CCNP class. In that class, we covered a wide range of networking topics, from configuring routing protocols like OSPF, to setting up access points and defending against Layer 2 attacks. 

Our networks were built on racks of CISCO routers and switches. We used PuTTY as our CLI. The network diagrams were made using draw.io.

The lab reports are currently in one large Word Doc.
